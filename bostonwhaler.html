        <h1><b>The Background of Boston Whaler</b></h1>
    </header>
    <p><em>Boston Whalers</em> are a very respected boat that play a role in our society today. The 
        reason that this boat is so great and well known is because they are considered unsinkable. 
        These are labeled unsinkable due to their foam-filled hull design. These types of boat were
        founded by Richard Fischer in 1958, who was searching to create a fundamentally safer boat.</p>

    <h2><b><a href="https://www.bostonwhaler.com/boat-models.html">Different types of Boston Whalers</a></b></h2>
    <p>Boston Whaler has a big range of different boats that they produce to start off they have the 
         13 Super sport which is the smallest boat they have then the biggest in their fleet is a 42 
          foot outrage. Then they have different types of whaler that range in different types of  
          hulls for the boats. The first being a Montauk, Dauntless, Outrage, Vantage, Conquest, and 
           Realm. All these different boats have specific meaning and advantages. The montauk is the 
           shallow boat where the hull is more round on the bottom and the largest they go is 21 
            feet. The Dauntless is similar but has a deeper V shape for the hull and it works better 
             in choppier water. The Outrage is typically used for an offshore boat, very popular for 
              fishermen. The vantage is a day boat, it is a bowrider and comes in a range of sizes such 
               as 24 up to 33. The conquest is unique because it has a cabin in the front of the boat. 
                Finally, the Realm is the bigger of the vantage with a similar layout but goes from 35 
                feet to 40 feet in sizes but also has a lot of cover from the wind due to the windshield 
                that covers the entire cabin.</p>
